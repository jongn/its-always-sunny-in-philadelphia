## What's this?
Inspired by [this](https://i.redd.it/5kkrjod2s3ay.png) post, as well as an obsession with It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, I made a Chrome extension to find the "closest episode" to the user's current time. If you don't know what I'm talking about, each episode of IASIP provides a time/day at the beginning:
